                      <p><img src="images/medical.png">Health Related Experience (HRE) is considered to be an individual’s exposure to the healthcare field, the patients and the healthcare professionals caring for them, but the exposure doesn’t permit the individual to provide healthcare, or the exposure is outside of the medical setting.  Examples of HRE include shadowing, transporting patients, patient education, clinical trial work other than DPC work itself, laboratory bench work, telephoning patients, non-nursing home health care, clerical work, electronic medical records work outside of patient care, office work.  Also, without exception, internships and other categories of educational training are considered HRE.

                          UF Admissions puts great stock in applicants who take the time and effort to regularly shadow PAs for a meaningful period of time. Regardless of your exposure to Physician Assistants in your work area, you are encouraged to seek out PAs to shadow on a regular basis and in a variety of settings. Opportunities such as these will help you  to better understand the variety of PA roles in primary care, e.g., family medicine, internal medicine, general pediatrics, and some of the many  subspecialties in which PAs serve the medical community</p>
